Users do not have to go to offline outlets to handle business, and administrators can adjust business according to background data. The platform mainly includes a blockchain bottom platform, a centralized server and multiple clients. Users and administrators perform various operations on the client. The client mainly expects to implement Android, WeChat applet, web and robot.


#### 2.1.2 Business requirements

BR1: The system is online for 3 months, and the number of users reaches 1,000. On the line for 6 months, the number of users reaches 10,000.

BR2: The system went online for 6 months, the amount of loan deposits reached 1,000, and the funds pool flowed normally.

BR3: The system is online for 12 months, and the perfect credit model is established.

### 2.2 Projects functions

SF1: Query the personal credit rating and use this to determine the credit line
SF2: Online application for loan, automatic review of the system
SF3: Guaranteed online processing of guarantee application, guarantee agreement on the chain
SF4: Bank deposits are saved and interest is earned
SF5: Analyze loan project classification and establish user portrait
SF6: Check the implementation of loan projects and adjust various interest rates

### 2.3 User characteristics

### 2.4 Constrains

CON1: Develop the server side in Java language, solidity language development blockchain
CON2: Graphical interface for operation
CON3: During the development process, the developer submits the software requirements specification document, design document and test report document.

### 2.5 Hypothesis and dependence

AE1: Users cannot guarantee others for existing loan applications or existing guarantee payments.
AE2: When the system's fund pool is below a certain limit, the user will not be offered loan approval on the same day.
AE3: When the user has overdue payment, the system will limit some functions of the user.
AE4: The system needs to provide the function of creating a new account to ensure the user's access rights.
AE5: The administrator account is a built-in account and is responsible for the internal maintenance of the platform.
